talk_title: "Disrupt the discourse: Messy data in China's digital authoritarianism and beyond",
abstract: "In this talk, I'll discuss fieldwork in Guiyang, China, looking specifically at the case of city police's Real Population platform. These population tracking platforms are becoming ubiquitous through China, and throughout the course of my research was surprised to find that the builders and makers of such platforms were emulating American systems of population tracking. I'll discuss the platform's realities and data 'messiness', as well as the broader consequences from China to the US.",
