talk_title: "Calculating the Souls of Black Folk: Reflections on Predictive Analytics in the Family Regulation System",
abstract: "Inspired by how Dubois opens Souls with music, I'll begin the story about the New York City Administration of Children's Services (ACS) with a poem to think about what's in excess of classification. I'll share how public criticism of The Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST)-automating decisions about which children should be separated from their families-has shaped the way NYC tells the story about predictive risk modeling in their own family regulation system. Riffing off Boots Riley's film, Sorry to Bother we'll think about voluntary incarceration, liberal permissiveness and strategies to undermine despairing certainty.",
