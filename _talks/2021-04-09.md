  abstract: "Matching algorithms for student assignment promise a fair and efficient allocation of public school seats. However, some school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. For example, San Francisco Unified School District is currently redesigning their student assignment algorithm because it was not promoting their goals of integration, equity, and transparency. Why havenâ€™t these algorithms lived up to expectations? And how might we be able to improve them? A human-centered approach to algorithm design can help us evaluate algorithms in their real world contexts, and highlights the limitations of purely algorithmic solutions to complex socio-political challenges.",
