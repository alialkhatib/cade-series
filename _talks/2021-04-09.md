  abstract: "Across the United States, a growing number of school districts are turning to matching algorithms to assign students to public schools. These algorithms have theoretical properties that promise a fair and efficient allocation of school seats. However, school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. For example, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely redesign their student assignment algorithm because it was not promoting their goals of integration, equity, and transparency. In this talk I will present findings from a mixed method study across San Francisco and Oakland Unified School Districts to understand why these algorithms have not lived up to their theoretical promise in practice. Our findings support the growing consensus that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central to aligning algorithmic values with real world conditions. In addition, we must broaden how we evaluate algorithms while recognizing the limitations of purely algorithmic solutions in addressing complex socio-political problems.",
