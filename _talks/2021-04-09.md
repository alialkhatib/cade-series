  abstract: "Matching algorithms for student assignment promise a fair and efficient allocation of public school seats. However, some school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. For example, San Francisco Unified School District is currently redesigning their student assignment algorithm because it was not promoting their goals of integration, equity, and transparency. Why havenâ€™t these algorithms lived up to expectations? And how might we be able to improve them? A human-centered approach to algorithm design can help us evaluate algorithms in their real world contexts, and highlights the limitations of purely algorithmic solutions to complex socio-political challenges.",

  abstract: "The U.S. Child Welfare System (CWS) is charged with improving outcomes for foster youth; yet the system is overburdened and underfunded. CWS has increasingly turned towards algorithms both as a means to reduce costs as well as produce efficient and consistent decisions. However, CWS staff must reach consensus decisions which are mediated by policies, child-welfare practice, and algorithms. Here, algorithms that do not account for legislative policies and practice only add to the frustrations of workers. Moreover, CWS is a highly contextual domain where the workers must make value-laden choices and engage in heuristics. Algorithms that do not account for these pertinent aspects of professional practice consequentially end up diminishing the quality of human discretionary work. How do we design sociotechnical systems within such constraints that exist in the public sector? How do we engage in ethical participatory design that empowers workers, offers them autonomy, and engages them as co-designers?",
