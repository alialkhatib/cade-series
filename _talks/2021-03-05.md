talk_title: "Justice-Oriented Ecologies: Working to Design Digital Technologies with communities for more socially just worlds",
abstract: "In this talk, I will bring together disparate but connected research disciplines in a discussion of how our research framing (methodologically, practically, and politically), can shape our understanding of what it means to â€˜do' social justice work with and through technologies. Using Nancy Fraser's ideas of multidimensional justice and Bonni Nardi and Vicky O'Day's Information Ecologies, I weave together a post-disciplinary exploration of what it means to design technologies for social and criminal justice with others. Drawing on more than 7 years of research with sex worker rights advocates, women's support organisations, those experiencing homelessness, and alcohol addiction peer support workers to design, develop, and think about the use of novel digital technologies, I developed the framework of Justice-Oriented Ecologies. The talk will centre on this framework, providing practical experiences, political insights, and methodological implications.",
