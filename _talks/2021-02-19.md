    talk_title: "Looking Beyond the Prototype: How 'supposed to' makes way for harm",
    abstract: "Categorization, organization, and labeling form the bases of algorithmic decision systems. Products of these algorithms have been shown to disparately, negatively impact individuals from traditionally marginalized and vulnerable groups. Algorithmic systems are systems of representation or \"different ways of organizing, clustering, arranging and classifying concepts, and of establishing complex relations between them,\" as defined by Hall (1997). But these systems, particularly those in the West, center certain attributes, creating a prototypical representation that all other data are measured against. It's important, then, to consider the harm in particular kinds of classifications, and devise methods of rethinking labeling and categorization to produce different artifacts of representation.",
